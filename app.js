Assumes this is a linear regression gradient descent function

Assumes the input_array is a training sample with one feature (not including bias term) and y term,
ie, [[2104, 460], [2104,460], [1416,232], [1534, 315], [852,178]], where [x,y] = [house sq ft, house price]

h(x) = a0 + a1*x

Let alpha be the learning rate.

Goal is to train the sample to determine the gradient
